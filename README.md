# Product Recomendation: Building a Robust Recommender

Abstract: Product recommenders are a key structure to many industries. People are searching for valuable recomendations they can use, and companies are looking to optimize profits. Using Amazon consumer reviews collected from Julian McAuley at UCSD, I focused on building a robust recommender to help consumers discover products they would enjoy. Focusing on Health and Personal Care, I build and test collaberative and hybrid recommenders.

Results: None to report yet.



# Background & Motivation
Recommenders are truely collaberative in nature. People are looking for products they will enjoy, venders are looking to better connect with consumers and sell their products. Outside of product sales, recommenders are very flexible and can be used in a variety of environments. It is important to create robust models which are capable of capturing the complexity of the user and the recommended product.

We live in a world with more choices than ever at our finger tips, often leading to the paradox of choice: too many choices create an inability to make a choice. Personalized recommendations can fix this.

## The Problem
How to deliver the right product to the right person?

We live in a world with more choices than ever at our finger tips, often leading to the paradox of choice: too many choices create an inability to make a choice.
